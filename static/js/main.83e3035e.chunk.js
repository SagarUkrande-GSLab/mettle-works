It is the seat of King County, Washington. Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. According to U.S. Census data released in 2019, the Seattle metropolitan area's population stands at 3.98 million, making it the 15th-largest in the United States.[9] In July 2013, Seattle was the fastest-growing major city in the United States[10] and remained in the top five in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%.[11] In July 2016, Seattle ranked as the fastest-growing major U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate.[12] Seattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington. It is the northernmost large city in the United States, located about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canadian border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.[13]",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),Object(u.jsx)("img",{src:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/USA_Washington_relief_location_map.jpg",width:"50%",height:"450"}),Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"Contents 1 History ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.1 Founding       ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.2 Duwamps      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.3 Incorporations      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.4 Timber town      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.5 Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great Depression      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"1.6 Post-war years: aircraft and software      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"2 Geography      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"2.1 Cityscape      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"2.2 Topography      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"2.3 Climate      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"3 Demographics      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"4 Economy      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"5 Culture      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"5.1 Nicknames      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"5.2 Performing arts      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"5.3 Tourism      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"6 Professional sports      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"7 Parks and recreation      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"8 Government and politics 9 Education      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"10 Media      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"11 Infrastructure      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),"11.1 Health systems      ",Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),'11.2 Transportation 11.3 Utilities 12 Notable people 13 Sister cities 14 See also 15 References 15.1 Footnotes 15.2 Citations 16 Bibliography 17 Further reading 18 External links What is Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book it has What is Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book it has Non-commercial radio stations include NPR affiliates KUOW-FM 94.9 and KNKX 88.5 (Tacoma), as well as classical music station KING-FM 98.1.

The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma\u2013Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett\u2013Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941.

An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016[333] and further extensions are planned to reach Northgate and Lynnwood to the north, Federal Way to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2024.[334][335] Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.[336] Utilities According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line.[322] The city has also been described by Bert Sperling as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by Walk Score as the sixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.[323][324] Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac, is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world. Closer to downtown, Boeing Field is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners. A secondary passenger airport, Paine Field, opened in 2019 and is located in Everett, 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle. It is predominantly used by Boeing and their large assembly plant located nearby.[325][326] The main mode of transportation, however, is the street system, which is laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern, except in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson Boren insisted on orienting the plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North.[327] Only two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways) run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. From 1953 to 2019, State Route 99 ran through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an elevated freeway on the waterfront. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The 2-mile (3.2 km) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion. The world's largest tunnel boring machine, named \"Bertha\", was commissioned for the project, measuring 57 feet (17 m) in diameter. The tunnel's opening was delayed to February 2019 due to issues with the tunnel boring machine, which included a two-year halt in excavation.[328] Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities, and is 10th among all North American cities according to Inrix.[329] The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit.
